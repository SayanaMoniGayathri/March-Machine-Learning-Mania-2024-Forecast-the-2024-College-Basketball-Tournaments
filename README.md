The March Machine Learning Mania 2024 competition on Kaggle challenges participants to forecast outcomes of the NCAA Division 1 Men’s and Women’s basketball tournaments using historical data. Participants will submit a portfolio of up to 100,000 brackets for each tournament. The evaluation metric is the Average Brier Bracket Score, which measures the accuracy of probabilistic predictions for each round. Each team must follow valid tournament paths in the predictions. Submissions are made via Kaggle Notebooks and must adhere to specific runtime and data usage rules. The competition runs from February 27, 2024, to April 10, 2024, with $50,000 in prizes awarded to the top entries.
